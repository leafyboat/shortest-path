/**
 * The moves the experimental sailing search uses for one boat speed.
 * <p>
 * A boat sails in one of 16 headings, and each tick it moves by that heading's velocity rounded to
 * quarter tiles, so the real direction of a heading depends on the speed: at speed 2, NNE moves 3
 * quarter tiles across and 7 up per tick (23.2 degrees, not 22.5). Holding a heading for 1, 2 or 4
 * ticks always lands a whole number of tiles away, with the boat at the same spot within its tile.
 * Each move here is one heading held for the fewest such ticks, so every leg of a path is a direction
 * the boat can actually sail. The search looks for the shortest route rather than the quickest, so each
 * move costs the distance it sails ({@link #length}).
 * <p>
 * The search uses the boat's base speed for the whole route, since speed boosts are random and
 * temporary; {@link #ESTIMATE} is the fallback when the base speed can't be read.
